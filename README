The main goal of this framework is to provide a solid base for all of your front-end projects. It will help you go through the initial steps	of creating a master template quickly, without having to worry about browser rendering issues for certain elements, including numerous JavaScript plugins to perform simple tasks or even worry about CSS naming conventions.

Why use Easy?

Easy is more than a CSS framework designed for building layouts. It includes built-in (jQuery powered) interactive functions that are so easy to use that you really don't have to know first thing about JavaScript. It also includes a library of preformatted and precoded CSS/HTML content blocks that you can simply paste into your master template. With a way of file organization it allow you to easily create your own content blocks. To sum it up Easy includes:

Solid CSS base in terms of HTML element styles and layout construction
Built-in interactive functions, extremely easy to use
Upgradeable HTML content blocks library
Easy is rock-solid, true all-in-one front-end solution that you can easily use as it is or customize to fit your own needs.

Getting to know Easy

In order to use any framework you need to get familiar with it. Only then can you tell if something is good for you or not. 
I suggest watching the screencast, reading documentation and taking a look at the demo files.

You can also schedule a 1-on-1 live session that will guide you through this framework and let you master it within 1 hour.
